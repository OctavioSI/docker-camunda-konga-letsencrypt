# docker-compose 4 camunda/konga/letsencrypt

A small collection of docker-compose files to setup a Camunda BPMN environment using postgres, along with kong and konga for API Management, all working together with SSL certificates generated by LetsEncrypt using acme-companion.




## Deployment

To deploy this project you will need first to setup the A records in your domain registrar, so as to point out your domain to the subdomains defined in the LetsEncrypt docker-compose configuration.

As such, you would have subdomains setup as follows:

```bash
  api.yourdomain.com            youripaddress
  konga.yourdomain.com          youripaddress
  camunda.yourdomain.com        youripaddress
```

After all subdomains are set, you can then edit the docker-compose files in this repo, clone them to your server and run

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose-camunda-konga.yml -f docker-compose-letsencrypt.yml up -d
```
